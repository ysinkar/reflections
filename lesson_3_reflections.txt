When would you want to create a remote repository for how long would you keep it local ?
Remote repository is useful for sharing code among multiple people and when there are multiple multiple contributing to it


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Any changes  made to local repo after the pull leads to merge and you would want to perform a merge at desired time rather than automatic.
